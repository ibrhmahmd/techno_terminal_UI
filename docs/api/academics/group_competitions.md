## Router Notes

- The Group Competitions router exposes **7 endpoints** for competition integration.
- All list endpoints support pagination with `skip` and `limit` parameters.
- Teams use soft delete (`is_deleted` flag) to preserve historical data integrity.
- Competition participation creates an audit trail with entry/exit timestamps.
